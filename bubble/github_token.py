"""GitHub authentication for containers via auth proxy or direct injection.

Most github settings use an HTTP reverse proxy on the host:
1. Receives plain HTTP git requests from the container
2. Validates the request targets only the allowed repository
3. Adds the real Authorization header
4. Forwards to GitHub over HTTPS

The host GitHub token never enters the container. Each container
gets a per-container bearer token scoped to one repository.

The "direct" setting bypasses the proxy entirely: the host's actual
GitHub token is injected into the container as GH_TOKEN and
GITHUB_TOKEN environment variables, giving unrestricted access.

For local containers (Linux or macOS/Colima), the container reaches the
host auth-proxy daemon directly over the incus bridge IP: git via
``url.insteadOf``, and gh via a small in-container ``socat`` forwarder
(gh wants a Unix socket; the forwarder relays it to the same bridge
TCP endpoint). No incus ``proxy``-type devices are created, so there
are no per-bubble ``forkproxy`` helpers to leak.

For remote/cloud containers, an SSH reverse tunnel forwards the local
proxy port to the remote host, then an Incus proxy device on the remote
exposes it into the container (a separate transport in
``setup_auth_proxy_remote``).

GitHub settings (each a strict superset of the one above):
  off:                      no GitHub access
  basic:                    git push/pull only
  rest:                     + repo-scoped REST API
  allowlist-read-graphql:   + allowlisted GraphQL queries
  allowlist-write-graphql:  + allowlisted GraphQL mutations (default)
  write-graphql:            + arbitrary GraphQL
  direct:                   raw token injection, no proxy
